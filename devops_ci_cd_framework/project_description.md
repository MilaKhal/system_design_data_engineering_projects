# DevOps for Enterprise Data Engineering
## Business Problem
JKL Enterprises lacks standardized CI/CD, leading to failures and slow releases. They requested an end‑to‑end DevOps blueprint: Git‑Ops workflow, IaC (Terraform/CDK), CI tests (DQ & unit), CD (blue‑green or Canary), and full observability—explicitly satisfying each requirement.
## Current Ecosystem
 - **VCS**: VCS: GitHub, Bitbucket
 - **Deploy**: manual
 - **Monitoring**: basic CloudWatch/Splunk

## Additional Technical & Business Requirements
1. **Primary users:** analysts, fraud ops, data scientists
2. **Success metrics:** deployment lead‑time ↓, failure rate ↓, MTTR ↓, reporting latency goals

## Proposed Architecture

### Git-Ops Workflow
A **Git-Ops** workflow will be implemented using a **central Git repository** as the single source of truth for both application code and infrastructure. Developers will create feature branches for new code or infrastructure changes. Pull Requests (PRs) will trigger automated CI tests. Once the PR is approved and merged into the main branch, a Git-Ops operator (like ArgoCD or Flux) will detect the change and automatically synchronize the desired state with the cluster. This ensures that all changes are auditable and that the live environment always matches the state of the Git repository.

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
**Terraform** is the recommended IaC tool. It provides a declarative syntax to define and manage infrastructure across multiple cloud providers.

 - **Requirement Satisfaction:**
   - **GitHub/Bitbucket Integration:** Terraform configuration files (.tf) will be stored in the same Git repository as the application code, linking the infrastructure to the application it supports.
   - **Reproducibility:** The entire data engineering environment, including data pipelines, compute resources (e.g., AWS EMR, Databricks clusters), and storage (e.g., S3 buckets, Snowflake databases), will be defined in code. This allows for creating identical environments (development, staging, production) from scratch.
   - **Version Control:** Every change to the infrastructure will be a version-controlled commit, allowing for rollbacks and a clear history of modifications.
   
### CI Tests
CI tests will be automated and triggered by every PR. These tests are critical for ensuring code quality and data integrity before deployment.

- **Requirement Satisfaction:**
  - **Data Quality (DQ) Tests:** **Great Expectations or dbt's data tests** will be used to validate the quality of incoming data. These tests will check for data completeness, uniqueness, referential integrity, and adherence to schema. For example, a DQ test might ensure that a customer_id column is always a positive integer and non-null.
  - **Unit Tests:** Standard programming language testing frameworks (e.g., pytest for Python, JUnit for Java) will be used to test the business logic of individual data transformation functions or pipeline components.
  - **GitHub Actions/Bitbucket Pipelines:** These CI services will be configured to automatically run the DQ and unit tests upon every code push to a branch. A failed test will block the PR from being merged.

### Continuous Deployment (CD)
**Blue-green deployment** is the recommended strategy for minimizing downtime and risk during releases.

- **Requirement Satisfaction:**
  - **Blue-Green Deployment:** A "blue" environment (the current production version) and a "green" environment (the new version) will exist. The new version will be fully deployed and tested in the "green" environment. Once validated, traffic will be switched from "blue" to "green" instantly using a load balancer or DNS change. If any issues arise, traffic can be instantly routed back to the "blue" environment, ensuring a quick and safe rollback. This is ideal for stateless services like API endpoints or batch data processing jobs.
  - **Canary Deployment:** For more complex or stateful services, a Canary deployment can be used. A small percentage of user traffic (e.g., 5-10%) is routed to the new version ("Canary") to monitor its performance and stability with real-world traffic before a full rollout. This is particularly useful for new data processing pipelines where you want to test with a subset of real data.
  - **Automated Deployment:** Once the CI pipeline passes, the merged code will trigger the CD process. The IaC tools will provision the new environment, and the application code will be deployed to it without manual intervention.

### Full Observability
**Full observability** is essential for quickly identifying and resolving issues. A combination of logging, metrics, and tracing will be used.

- **Requirement Satisfaction:**
  - **Centralized Logging:** **Splunk** will be retained and enhanced to collect and centralize logs from all components of the data ecosystem (applications, infrastructure, databases). This allows for a single place to search and analyze logs for debugging.
  - **Metrics & Dashboards:** **CloudWatch** will be used to collect key metrics (e.g., pipeline run times, data volume processed, error rates, resource utilization). Custom dashboards will be built in CloudWatch to provide a real-time view of the health and performance of the data pipelines and infrastructure.
  - **Alerting:** Automated alerts will be configured in CloudWatch to notify the team via email or Slack when specific thresholds are exceeded (e.g., a data pipeline fails, a storage bucket fills up, or CPU utilization spikes). This enables a **proactive** response to failures rather than a reactive one.
  - **Tracing:** Distributed tracing tools (e.g., **AWS X-Ray or Jaeger**) will be implemented to visualize the flow of data and requests across different microservices or pipeline stages. This helps pinpoint bottlenecks or failures in complex, multi-stage data flows.
